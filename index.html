            <h5>Hamilton's Ferrari dream lights up: Another masterstroke in the making?</h5>
            <p>Lewis Hamilton's move to Ferrari in 2025 was announced before the 2024 Formula 1 season even started. The sport has completed just five races in the 2024 season, but Hamilton's move to Ferrari has suddenly become tastier. Has the seven-time World Champion made a masterstroke again?</p>

            <h5>Scuderia Ferrari are set to change their colour from red for the first time since 1964, as they announce special livery ahead of the Miami Grand Prix</h5>
            <p>Ferrari have enjoyed a successful start to the 2024 Formula 1 season, as they have made impressive strides in their attempt to catch the high-flying Red Bull.
              Both their drivers have maximised results and they sit 3rd and 4th in the driver standings with Charles Leclerc ahead of his teammate Carlos Sainz.</p>

            <h5>Verstappen hails ‘amazing’ weekend in China as he takes victory amid multiple restarts</h5>
            <p>Max Verstappen has called his weekend at the Chinese Grand Prix “amazing” after storming to victory in Sunday’s race, following on from his win on Saturday during the first Sprint of 2024.

              The Dutchman made a strong getaway from pole, as the 56-lap encounter began, and from there faced a mostly unchallenged drive to the win, despite plenty of drama unfolding behind him when a Safety Car was called midway through the event after Valtteri Bottas pulled off track with a mechanical issue.</p>
